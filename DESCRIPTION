Description: Computes continuous (not step) empirical (and nonparametric) probability density, cumulative distribution and quantile functions. Supports univariate, multivariate and conditional probability distributions, some kernel smoothing features and weighted data (possibly useful mixed with fuzzy clustering). Can compute multivariate and conditional probabilities. Also, can compute conditional medians, quantiles and modes.
